	<li>Step 1 Saute the filling for the egg roll
Egg Roll is the easiest thing to prepare as it is ready in very less time. Cut thick slices of onion and capsicum, grate the carrots, mince the ginger and keep aside. Take a tawa or frying pan and put it on medium heat. When it is sufficiently hot add one teaspoon of butter and the onions, carrots and capsicum. Cook on high flame for 2 minutes. Add salt, pepper, lemon juice, tomato ketchup, chilli sauce and cook for another one minute. Remove from fire and keep aside.</li>

<li>Step 2 Prepare the egg-chapati covering
In a bowl, break the eggs. Add salt and pepper to taste and whisk well. Heat one tsp butter in the pan. Add half of the egg mixture and make an omelette. Put the chapati over it. Top it with the rest of the egg mixture and flip so that it is cooked on both sides.</li>

<li>Step 3 Add the filling & make the roll
Spoon the cooked capsicum, carrot and onion mixture at the centre of the chapati and fashion it into a roll. Serve hot with tomato ketchup.</li>
